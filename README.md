# Crop Care | Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Overview
Crop Care is a machine learning-powered web application designed to detect plant diseases from images of leaves with high accuracy. Leveraging a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system classifies plant diseases in real-time, providing users with quick diagnoses. The web app, built with Flask, allows users to upload leaf images and receive results in just 5 seconds, ensuring timely intervention for crop protection.

## Features
- **Custom CNN Model**: Designed and trained for precise leaf disease classification, achieving 95% accuracy in disease detection.
- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance model performance and reduce processing time without compromising accuracy.
- **Flask Web Application**: Developed a responsive web app using Python's Flask framework for easy image upload and instant disease diagnosis.
- **Bootstrap Interface**: Ensured a smooth and engaging user experience with a modern, responsive UI crafted using Bootstrap.
- **Real-time Diagnosis**: The system processes and returns disease detection results within 5 seconds, making it highly efficient for practical use in agriculture.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language used for building the machine learning model and backend.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the web application for image upload and result display.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Machine Learning**: Custom CNN model trained on leaf images for plant disease classification.
- **PCA**: Used to optimize the model by reducing data dimensionality.
